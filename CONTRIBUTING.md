   git checkout -b feature/my-cool-feature
   ```
3. Make your changes
4. Run tests (if any) and check your code; make sure your changes didn't break anything
5. Commit with a clear message:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix: clarify reroll button behavior"

## Coding style

* Use **4 spaces for indentation** — no tabs
* Follow **PEP8** Python style as much as possible
* Use snake_case for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes, and SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants
* Write **reST-flavored docstrings** for functions and classes
* Keep your code **modular** — break functionality into reusable parts
* Avoid **code duplication** — reuse functions and import local modules where possible
* Use **meaningful variable and function names**
* Comment tricky parts so others (and future you) understand
* Keep your code clean and readable
* Run any existing tests to make sure you didn’t break stuff
